## Proces
### First ideas 
So, first off I thought about Spotify immediately, because I love music, I was recently chanting that I wanted to try the Spotify API. But last year someone had a similar idea, and other people this year too. I think I'll save the API for a personal project. 
Secondly, I thought about watching movies together even though there's a distance. Yes it's a thing, I watch movies with someone far far away. That experience could be greatly enhanced. 
But it's a bit, idk, boring? And I'm a little afraid in terms of jurisdiction and for instance the Netflix APi. 

Anyway, I thought, why not make a realtime translation webapp. It would become a smaller world if you'd be able to talk to someone in Japan or Mexico. A whole world would open up. I know there are similar existing applications, but not a lot, and I could add other features as well. 
I figured the Google translate API is something I don't really want to touch because I don't want to give away any credit card credentials. But there are great alternatives I've seen so far. Like the Bing translation API. Gonna dive a little deeper and check if my concept will hold up with some tuning. 

### Week 1 : Setup
Started with getting my repo up and running and setting up my express server. 
Once this was ready, I claimed my Mongo Atlas student privileges and I followed a chat demo / tutorial. 
The tutorial was written in jQuery, so I wrote it in Vanilla JS. 
Made a message scheme with Mongoose. Added Socket.io and deployed on Heroku. There were some startup issues, like the whitelisting of IP addresses. Because Heroku has highly variable IP addresses. 
So I went to Stackoverflow but unfortunately they gave me an answer I was afraid of. The only and easy solution is to whitelist everything while not in production mode. So I went with that.
