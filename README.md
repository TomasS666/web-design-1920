## Proces

### Week 1

#### Meeting with Larissa
Our "team" met up with Larissa this week. We're gonna make an exclusive design for her. Larissa is blind. Well for the biggest part she can't see. She can still recognize some shapes. If she really wants to and focusses and the typography on a screen has huge contrast and it's super big, she can read small parts. But it's almost an impossible task and it requires a lot of energy. So she rather doesn't. 


#### Q & A with Larissa
#### Testing / explaining concepts

#### Larissa from the design principles perspective
### Study situation
* She's very ambitious,
* Does top-class sport in track cycling (Olympic level), but doesn't like the sport itself too much. She loves it more because of the game, the challenge, the fanaticism and to win.
* Studies IT at the HVA, had some delay because she's a busy with the top-class track cycling. So she has a busy life
* Also a point of contact for accesability related topics at the HVA.

### Ignore conventions
For me to ignore conventions, it was good to have a talk with her. Because we assume things, but in reality they're more often than not false.  
### Prioritize identity
### Add nonsense

#### Testing the NS website with a screenreader
##### Testing accesability
