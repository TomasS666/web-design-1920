## Concept

### Used data and APIs




### 1. Study Situation
* The way Larissa and Larissa alone navigates, thinks, has her own conventions, how she acces the web. What she wants to get out of the web, what her screen-reader (in this case) behaves and how she interacts with content, etc.


### 2. Ignore Conventions
* Put conventions aside where it's not fitting Larissa her needs. I let go of aria attributes for the biggest part, and let introduced more lists with list-items instead of tables, because Larissa personally and with her screen-reader, she is faster by checking out the list-items. Is it a convention? Or a hundred procent semantic? No, but it fits her specific needs and expectations.

### 3. Prioritise identity
So, the idea is to ignore conventions, but not all of them. Okay, this might sound vague. But I think of it like this. 
What if you have to fill a bucket of water for someone else. And the convention is that you need a bucket to be able to receive that water. And or a convention is that only one size of bucket suffices. Bringing it with your hands might not be the best idea. So no, it doesn't have to be a bucket, but what if it was a pot or a bag. You can bring the water to the person in other ways. It doesn't really matter how many ways there are to bring the water to it's receiver. You should study situation and when you think a bucket is the way to go, go with a bucket. When a balloon is better, go with a balloon. It's not that you have to forcefully use your hands, just so you ignore the bucket. It's a princple that helps us as designers understand how we can get the water from A to B, that there are multiple ways, and which way best serves it's purpose for the receiving person. 


### 4. Add nonsense
* Relax room
* Want to put Larissa in control, so no nonsense where it bothers her. But nonsense in place, and a little dynamic nonsense


## Wishlist


## Known bugs
* JAWS configuration has a lot of impact on interation. Not only does it change a voice or the ways it speaks, it changes the whole context of the OS. It can overwrite Javascript events, it changes keyboard events, etc. So my idea of implementing custom keyboard events didn't work out. But good to know.
* Can't entirely control the speed and pauses of the JS speechsyntheses. There must be a way, but I didn't find it right now. It causes the clue to a joke to be spoken out a little too soon.

* I can't and I shouldn't control the flow of the document too much with aria attributes because JAWS either talks more where I don't want it and less where I would want it to read.

## Future features
* More dynamic relax room
* Generic option for accepting some sort of default excel format

## Conclusion
Full conclusion here: [Wiki/conclusion](https://github.com/TomasS666/web-design-1920/wiki/Final-conclusion)

"it's all about Larissa and enabling her by the design to have her own experience which at suits her purpose."
"...involve people as soon as possible in your design process. Design together this way, iterate within the design and test proces, put people in the center of your design. Don't let people adapt to your design, adapt your design to the people."
